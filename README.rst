=======

The examples from Mastering OpenCV 4 with Python by Alberto Fernández Villán.

Book codes are available on `github <https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenCV-4-with-Python>`_.

PS.
===
Will not proceed with this book anymore due to diverse installation/execution errors. OpenCV lib of python doesn't seem very powerful for now.
Hope to come back to this topic one day..
